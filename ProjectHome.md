This is an extremely narrow-scoped tool, meant to help with whatever crazy contraption MC Frontalot has found to help him playback music.  It sorts files by (Creation?) date no matter what, so this utility will let him sort files and rejigger the creation date automatically.

If anyone else happens to find it useful, cool!

Drag files onto the list on the right side, and then drag them within the list to rearrange them.  When you're ready, hit "Change dates" and you're done: it'll change the dates to be in order (essentially going X minutes into the past and counting forward, where X is the number of items in the list).
